# bintray-erlang-solutions
This repository is used for copying [Erlang Solutions' packages](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html) into [Bintray](https://bintray.com/raniemi/erlang-solutions-unofficial-mirror) for reliability and performance reasons.

The actual copy is performed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/raniemi/bintray-erlang-solutions) when a push is made to master.

Currently only [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) packaging for [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) releases are supported.
